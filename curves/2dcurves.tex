\label{sec:2dcurves}

In this chapter we will start by showing the familiar functions of one variable $y=f(x)$. We will quickly
find out that these are somewhat limited in the variety of shapes they can express, 
which leads onwards to the more general parametric 2D curves.

\section{Functions of one variable}
\label{sec:simplefuncs}

A function of one variable, $y=f(x)$ simply connects pairs of numbers: For each $x$ there is a corresponding $y$.
Functions of one variable are suitable for representing simple relations where the $x$ values
are increasing continuously (time, days, months, ...). This means that we cannot use this method to draw
geometry such as circles, ellipses and other closed or self intersecting shapes shown in 
figures \ref{fig-circle2d} and \ref{fig-intersect}.

\index{length of!a curve}
The length of a curve specified as y=f(x) is

$$
  \int_a^b\sqrt{(dx)^2 + (\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}dx)^2}=\int_a^b\sqrt{1+(y')^2}dx
$$

The formula can be understood in terms of \myindx{Pythagoras formula} for small changes in $x$ and $y$:  If  
we increment $x$ by $dx$ from $x_0$ to $x_0 + dx$ the corresponding change in $y$, $dy$ is the rate
that $y$ changes with $x$, $\partial y/\partial x$ evaluated at $x_0$,
multiplied with $dx$. The total length is then the \myindx{hypotenuse}
of the right angle triangle with sides $dx$ and $dy$, which is $\sqrt{(dx)^2 + (dy)^2}$. This is 
illustrated in figure \ref{fig-delta_l}.
Integrating this formula over the interval of interest gives the total length of the 
curve.

\section{Parametric Curves}

We now introduce \myindx{parametric curves}. Instead of letting $y$ vary as a function $f(x)$ we now 
let both $x$ and $y$ depend on $t$. This can be visualized by imagining an 'o' drawn with a pen. 
As the pen draws a circle (counter clockwise, starting from the top) you can imagine how the $x$ and $y$ coordinates vary:
First $x$ decreases while $y$ barely changes, then both $x$ and $y$ are decreasing. When we reach the bottom of
the 'o' $x$ is increasing while $y$ only moves slightly, etc. As it takes some time to draw the 'o'
each point is drawn at a certain moment of time, or simply that $\vec{r}(t)= \Big( x(t), y(t) \Big)$.
Let's give some examples. 

The straight line $y=ax+b$ is parametrized as $(t, at+b)$

The curve  given by $y=\sin(x)$ is parametrized by $(t, \sin(t))$

And the general case $y=f(x)$ is parametrized as $(t, f(t))$.\\

So far we have just covered the functions mentioned earlier, but now we can also let the x-coordinate 
vary. For example $(\sin(t),\cos(t))$ draws a circle with radius 1 and center (0,0). For further examples 
see figures \ref{fig-circle2d} and \ref{fig-intersect}.

\end{figure}



The length of curves specified as (x,y)=(f(t),g(t)) is given in a similar way as for the simple 
curves mentioned in section \ref{sec:simplefuncs} as we again use Pythagoras. Using the relation

$$
   \Big(\dd{x}{t}dt\Big)^2 + \Big(\dd{y}{t}dt\Big)^2 = \Big(\dot{f(t)}dt\Big)^2 +  \Big(\dot{g(t)}dt\Big)^2
$$
we get for the length of the curve 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:length}
  \mathcal{L} = \int_a^b\sqrt{(dx)^2 + (dy)^2} = 
  \int_a^b\sqrt{(\dot{f})^2 + (\dot{g})^2}dt
\end{equation}

Finally we should mention the parameter $t$. If no limits are specified then we assume that $t$ can take 
the values from $-\infty < t < \infty$. Sometimes, as in the case of the circle this would create 
endless loops around the same curve. In such cases an interval can be specified as $t \in [0;2\pi]$,
meaning that $t$ runs from $0$ to $2\pi$.
