\section{Simulations}
\IEEEPARstart{H}{ere}
we perform some simulations combining MAC address table models with the three hashing functions mentioned 
above. We adopt the nomenclature from \cite{Stancu2003}, in which the MAC addresses used in the simulations
are constructed by a combination of arbitrarily chosen but fixed values denoted $xx, yy$ and $zz$. $\alpha\alpha$
are linearly generated numbers and $\beta\beta$ and $\gamma\gamma$ are random numbers. For example using a value of
xx:yy:zz:$\alpha\alpha$:$\alpha\alpha$:$\alpha\alpha$ means that the vendor ID (the three first bytes) is fixed at some value, and the 
device ID (the last three bytes) are varied linearly starting at 00:00:00. The patterns we have chosen to simulate are

xx:yy:zz:00:$\alpha\alpha$:$\alpha\alpha$

$\beta\beta$:$\beta\beta$:$\beta\beta$:$\alpha\alpha$:$\alpha\alpha$:$\alpha\alpha$

$\beta\beta$:$\beta\beta$:$\beta\beta$:$\gamma\gamma$:$\gamma\gamma$:$\gamma\gamma$

and the random numbers are uniformly distributed.
